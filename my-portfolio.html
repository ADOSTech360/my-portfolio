	<h2> About Me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> I am originally from Portland recently relocated from <em>SoCal</em></li>
			<li> I attended PSU (Portland State University) pursuing a Bachelors of Arts in Social Sciences and a minor in System Science. I am currently a long term senior and have yet to return to complete my degree.</li>
			<li>I have experience as an IT professional, technology trainer and business consultant. </li>
			<li> I have played around with html since the early 90s but did not seriously pursue the goal of becoming a programmer until now.</li>
		</ul>
	<h2> My Hobbies </h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Music</li>
				<p> I have played instruments since a child. I have been fortunate to play in various bands, churches, community events, bars, weddings and jam essions throught the Portland metropolitan area and a little in Southern California.</p>
			<li>Dance</li>
				<p> I use to be a ballroom dance instructor and I still very much enjoy the Salsa, Waltz and Tango dances respectively. I especially miss dancing right now since the closures of clubs due to the ongoing pandemic. <em> To dance is to live!</em></p>
			<li>Technology</li>
				<p>I want to Benson Polytechnic High School and I majored in Micro Computer Technology. This 2 year course was a CompTIA A+ Certification prepatory course with college credits. I have been working on and breaking down computers since a pre teen. I am <em>especially fascinated</em> by new innovations in the <strong>AR/VR</strong>, Robotics/Drones, and automotive spaces. I hope to one day work for a company that is pushing the bleeding edge of technology coupled with a <strong>human centered</strong> focus as it relates to innovations.</p>
			<li> People</li>
				<p>I am particularly interested in <em>how</em>people function in groups, how individuals at the edges/extremes are wired and the <em>why</em> behind their actions. I think that a lot can be learned by understanding the exceptions and finding the connections/patterns between the vast differently outcomes despite a shared reality.
				<br>
				I believe that technology may be moving too fast for the current state of the human condition. If we are truly in pursuit of the "good life" we must understand what makes a life <em>good</em> versus what simply makes us <em>"feel good"</em>
				<br>
				As you may have suspected, I love introspective questions and deep conversations about rise and fall of civilizations and the lessons to be learned from the ancestors of antiquity.</p>
			<li> Leadership</li>
				<p> I recoginze that leadership is a quality that most companies desire to see and grown in their employees. I also understand that good leadership is a hard thing to come by and an even hard characteristic to obtain. Questions like, <em>"What makes a good leader?,"</em> or <em>How does one become a <strong>strong and confident</strong> leader?</em>c come to mind. There are libraries of books, seminars, tapes, programs, podcasts and apps that allow us to explore this topic, however leadership is not evaluated in theories, methods or systems, leadership is socialized soley through practice and that comes from experiences.</p>
